## ✅ DAO Validation Process (SmartIntelDAO)

### 🛠️ Overview

This document outlines the decentralized validation flow for threat reports submitted to the SmartIntelDAO platform.

---

### 🔁 Process Flow Diagram

1. **User submits a report**

   * Type: Scam address, deepfake, misinformation, anomaly
   * Fields: title, description, evidence (links, media, tx hash)

2. **System generates a SHA-256 hash**

   * `hash = SHA256(report)`
   * Hash stored on-chain (Ethereum or L2)

3. **Metadata stored off-chain**

   * IPFS or database
   * Links to evidence, time of submission, author wallet (pseudonymous)

4. **DAO Validation Phase**

   * Stake-based or reputation-based voting (Snapshot, Aragon, or custom DAO contract)
   * Voting period: 48–72h
   * Consensus threshold: e.g., 60% approval or 5 expert votes

5. **Result**

   * If valid → added to official feed, flagged as trusted
   * If rejected → returned to user with reason

### 🔐 Why It’s Secure

* Immutable hash prevents tampering
* Decentralized consensus avoids single-point control
* Evidence can be public/auditable

---

### 📊 Example Use Case

Report:

* Title: "Phishing dApp draining wallets"
* Address: `0x123...abc`
* Evidence: screenshots, on-chain tx, user testimonials
* Hash: `0x98f7...0a9`

DAO Voting:

* 12 members vote → 9 approve, 3 reject → Validated
* Timestamp and outcome logged on-chain

### 🎯 Pitch Deck Highlights (internal meeting)

1. **Problem**: Centralized intel feeds are slow, costly, and blind to the fringe
2. **Solution**: DAO-based validation system with community-curated, verifiable reports
3. **MVP Impact**:

   * Plug into MDR team as early OSINT signal layer
   * Serve SMBs with zero-cost threat validation
4. **Differentiator**: Combines automation (hash) + consensus (DAO) + transparency (on-chain)
5. **Call to Action**: Greenlight PoC testing inside MDR team with real alert simulation
